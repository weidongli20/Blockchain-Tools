Screenshots of connecting MyCrypto to custom chain of Ganache, importing the pre-funded wallet, then sending test transactions.

* First, get the private key of the pre-funded address using Ganache('https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache')

* Open up MyCrypto to get the private key of the ETH address you use to pre-fund your chain. Be sure the `Kovan` network is selected.
